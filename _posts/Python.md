# Complete Python Learning Guide: From Beginner to Advanced

Welcome to this comprehensive Python guide designed for beginners who want to grow into advanced concepts. Since you're working on a Chromebook without the ability to download software, we'll focus on browser-based solutions that will enable you to code effectively.

## Online Python Environments

Before we dive into Python concepts, here are some browser-based environments where you can write and run Python code:

1. **[Trinket.io](http://trinket.io/)** - A user-friendly environment that's perfect for beginners
2. **[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)** - Offers a free tier with a browser-based console
3. **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** - Great for data science and has excellent support for libraries
4. **[CodePen](https://codepen.io/)** - Primarily for web development but supports Python with Pyodide

Throughout this guide, I'll provide code examples that you can directly copy into any of these environments.

## 1. Python Basics: Variables and Data Types

### Variables

Variables in Python are containers for storing data values.

```python
# Creating a variable
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

**Why use variables?** Variables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your program, making your code more readable and maintainable.

### Python Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

1. **Numeric Types**:
   - **int**: For whole numbers
   - **float**: For decimal numbers
   - **complex**: For complex numbers

```python
count = 10            # int
temperature = 98.6    # float
complex_num = 3 + 4j  # complex
```

2. **Sequence Types**:
   - **str**: For text (strings)
   - **list**: Ordered, mutable collection
   - **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection

```python
name = "Python"           # str
languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Ruby"]  # list
coordinates = (10, 20)    # tuple
```

3. **Mapping Type**:
   - **dict**: Key-value pairs

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  # dict
```

4. **Set Types**:
   - **set**: Unordered collection of unique items
   - **frozenset**: Immutable set

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set
```

5. **Boolean Type**:
   - **bool**: True or False

```python
is_active = True  # bool
```

**Why understand data types?** Different data types have different properties and operations. Knowing which data type to use for a given situation helps you write more efficient and error-free code.

## 2. Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.

```python
# Creating strings
single_quoted = 'Hello'
double_quoted = "World"
triple_quoted = '''This is a
multi-line string'''
```

### String Operations

```python
# Concatenation
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # "Hello World"

# Repetition
stars = "*" * 10  # "**********"

# Indexing
first_char = greeting[0]  # "H"

# Slicing
substring = greeting[0:5]  # "Hello"

# Length
length = len(greeting)  # 11
```

### String Methods

```python
text = "Python Programming"

# Case conversion
print(text.upper())      # "PYTHON PROGRAMMING"
print(text.lower())      # "python programming"

# Finding substrings
print(text.find("Pro"))  # 7

# Replacing
print(text.replace("Programming", "Coding"))  # "Python Coding"

# Splitting
print(text.split())      # ["Python", "Programming"]
```

**Why learn string manipulation?** Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in programming, and Python offers powerful tools to work with them. Mastering string operations is essential for tasks like text processing, data cleaning, and user interface development.

## 3. Control Flow: Conditionals

Conditionals allow your program to make decisions.

### If-Else Statements

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
```

### Ternary Operator

```python
# Compact if-else (ternary operator)
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"
```

**Why use conditionals?** Conditionals allow your program to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions, making your applications responsive to different scenarios.

## 4. Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.

### For Loops

```python
# Looping through a range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Enumerate for index and value
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```

### While Loops

```python
# While loop with a condition
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Loop Control

```python
# Break - exit the loop
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Continue - skip current iteration
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)  # Prints odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

**Why use loops?** Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks, processing collections of data, and implementing algorithms that need to perform operations multiple times.

## 5. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

### Defining Functions

```python
# Simple function
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Function with parameters
def greet_person(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function with return value
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Calling Functions

```python
greet()  # Prints: Hello, World!
greet_person("Alice")  # Prints: Hello, Alice!
result = add(3, 5)  # result = 8
```

**Why use functions?** Functions promote code reuse, make your code more organized, and help break down complex problems into manageable pieces.


## 6. Function Arguments

In Python, there are several ways to pass arguments to functions, giving you flexibility in how you design your code.

### Default Arguments

Default arguments allow a function to use a predetermined value if no value is provided.

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    # greeting has a default value of "Hello"
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))           # "Hello, Alice!"
print(greet("Bob", "Hi there")) # "Hi there, Bob!"
```

**Why use default arguments?** They make functions more flexible by allowing optional parameters, reducing the number of similar functions you need to write.

### Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments let you specify which parameter gets which value when calling a function.

```python
def create_profile(name, age, occupation):
    return f"{name} is {age} years old and works as a {occupation}."

# Using keyword arguments (order doesn't matter)
profile = create_profile(age=30, name="Charlie", occupation="developer")
```

**Why use keyword arguments?** They make function calls more readable and allow you to skip the need to remember parameter order.

### Variable-Length Arguments

Sometimes you might want a function to accept any number of arguments.

```python
# *args: Collects positional arguments into a tuple
def sum_all(*numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Can take any number of arguments

# **kwargs: Collects keyword arguments into a dictionary
def print_info(**details):
    for key, value in details.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=25, country="Wonderland")
```

**Why use variable-length arguments?** They allow you to create highly flexible functions that can handle different amounts of input data.

## 7. Data Structures

### Lists in Depth

A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. Items can be of different data types.

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Access elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"
last_fruit = fruits[-1]  # "cherry"

# Slicing
subset = fruits[0:2]  # ["apple", "banana"]

# Modifying lists
fruits.append("orange")       # Add item to end
fruits.insert(1, "blueberry") # Insert at position
fruits.remove("banana")       # Remove by value
popped = fruits.pop()         # Remove and return last item
fruits.sort()                 # Sort in-place
sorted_fruits = sorted(fruits)  # Return sorted copy
```

**Why use lists?** Lists are versatile containers that allow you to organize related items and perform operations on them as a group.

### Using List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

```python
# Traditional way
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# Using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# With conditional logic
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

**Why use list comprehensions?** They make your code more readable and often more efficient by combining multiple operations into a single line.

### Tuples and Their Methods

A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items.

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Methods
count = coordinates.count(10)  # Count occurrences of a value
index = coordinates.index(20)  # Find index of a value

# Unpacking
x, y = coordinates  # x = 10, y = 20
```

**Why use tuples?** Tuples are good for data that shouldn't change, and their immutability provides some protection against accidental modifications. They can also be used as dictionary keys, unlike lists.

### Dictionaries in Depth

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

```python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript"]
}

# Accessing values
name = person["name"]  # "Alice"
# Safer access that won't raise an error if key doesn't exist
age = person.get("age", 0)  # 25 (or default 0 if not found)

# Modifying dictionaries
person["location"] = "New York"  # Add new key-value pair
person.update({"age": 26, "job": "Developer"})  # Update multiple keys
del person["skills"]  # Remove a key
skills = person.pop("skills", [])  # Remove and return value (with default)

# Iterating through dictionaries
for key in person:
    print(key, person[key])

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)
```

**Why use dictionaries?** Dictionaries provide a way to store data with labeled "keys" instead of numeric indices, making your data self-descriptive and easy to access.

## 8. Error and Exception Handling

In programming, errors will happen. Exception handling allows your program to respond to errors gracefully.

### Types of Errors

- **Syntax Errors**: Errors in the structure of your code that prevent it from running.
- **Runtime Errors (Exceptions)**: Errors that occur while your program is running.

### Try-Except Blocks

```python
try:
    # Code that might cause an error
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
    print("Result:", result)
except ValueError:
    # Runs if a ValueError occurs (e.g., user enters text instead of a number)
    print("Please enter a valid number")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
except Exception as e:
    # Catches any other exceptions
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    # Runs if no exceptions occur
    print("Calculation successful")
finally:
    # Always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred
    print("Execution completed")
```

**Why use exception handling?** It allows your program to continue running even when errors occur, providing a better user experience and preventing crashes.

## 9. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" (instances of classes) to structure code.

### Key OOP Concepts

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.
- **Attribute**: A variable that belongs to a class or object.
- **Method**: A function that belongs to a class or object.
- **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class.

### Creating Classes and Objects

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    # Initializer / Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes (unique to each instance)
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
    
    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

# Creating objects (instances)
my_dog = Dog("Rex", 3)
your_dog = Dog("Bella", 5)

# Accessing attributes
print(my_dog.name)  # "Rex"
print(your_dog.species)  # "Canis familiaris"

# Calling methods
print(my_dog.bark())  # "Rex says Woof!"
print(your_dog.get_info())  # "Bella is 5 years old."
```

**Why use OOP?** OOP helps organize code, model real-world entities, reuse code through inheritance, and encapsulate data for better maintenance and scalability.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

```python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def show_info(self):
        print(f"I am {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

class Cat(Pet):  # Cat inherits from Pet
    def __init__(self, name, age, color):
        # Call the parent class's __init__ method
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.color = color
    
    def purr(self):
        print("Purrrr")
    
    # Override the parent's method
    def show_info(self):
        print(f"I am {self.name}, a {self.color} cat and I am {self.age} years old.")

my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", 2, "tabby")
my_cat.show_info()  # Uses Cat's version of show_info
my_cat.purr()       # Method unique to Cat
```

**Why use inheritance?** Inheritance promotes code reuse and creates a logical relationship between classes, making your code more organized and easier to understand.

## 10. File Operations

Python makes it easy to work with files for reading, writing, and manipulating data.

### Reading Files

```python
# Basic file reading
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Read entire file
    print(content)

# Read line by line
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes the newline character

# Read all lines into a list
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())
```

### Writing Files

```python
# Write to a file (overwrites existing content)
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")

# Append to a file
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis line is appended.")
```

**Why use the `with` statement?** The `with` statement automatically handles file closing, even if an error occurs, preventing resource leaks.

**Why is file handling important?** File operations allow your programs to store and retrieve data persistently, enable data processing from external sources, and facilitate communication between different programs.

## 11. Modules and Packages

A module is a file containing Python code. A package is a collection of modules.

### Importing Modules

```python
# Import the entire module
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4.0

# Import specific functions
from math import sqrt, pi
print(sqrt(16))  # 4.0
print(pi)        # 3.141592653589793

# Import with an alias
import math as m
print(m.sqrt(16))  # 4.0

# Import all functions (not recommended for large modules)
from math import *
print(sqrt(16))  # 4.0
```

### Defining Your Own Modules

You can create your own modules to organize and reuse your code.

```python
# File: mymath.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# File: main.py
import mymath

result = mymath.add(5, 3)  # 8
```

**Why use modules?** Modules help organize your code, make it more maintainable, and allow you to reuse code across different programs.

## 12. Algorithms and Data Structures

### Basic Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

#### Searching Algorithms

```python
# Linear Search
def linear_search(arr, target):
    """
    Search for a target value in an array by checking each element one by one.
    Returns the index if found, or -1 if not found.
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Binary Search (requires a sorted array)
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Search for a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
    Returns the index if found, or -1 if not found.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

**Why learn search algorithms?** They help you efficiently find items in collections, which is a common task in programming.

#### Sorting Algorithms

```python
# Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sort an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Flag to optimize if array is already sorted
        swapped = False
        
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        
        # If no swapping occurred in this pass, array is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    
    return arr
```

**Why learn sorting algorithms?** Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in many applications.

### Advanced Data Structures

#### Stacks and Queues

A **stack** is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.

```python
# Implementing a stack using a list
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
    
    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

A **queue** is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

```python
# Implementing a queue using a list
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)
    
    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

**Why learn about stacks and queues?** They are fundamental data structures that help solve many programming problems, such as managing function calls, implementing undo/redo functionality, and modeling real-world systems like print queues.

## 13. Working with External Code Packages

Python's ecosystem includes thousands of packages that extend its functionality.

### Using pip (in environments where it's available)

Note: Since you're using a Chromebook without the ability to install packages, you'll need to use online environments that have pre-installed packages or allow installation.

```python
# In platforms that support pip (like PythonAnywhere)
# pip install requests
```

### Using Pre-installed Packages in Online Environments

Many online Python environments come with popular packages pre-installed.

```python
# Using the requests library for HTTP requests
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
```

**Why use external packages?** They save you time by providing pre-built solutions to common problems, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your application.

## 14. Advanced Control Flow

### Comprehensions for Different Data Structures

```python
# List comprehension (we saw this earlier)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]

# Dictionary comprehension
square_dict = {x: x**2 for x in numbers}
# Result: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# Set comprehension
square_set = {x**2 for x in numbers}
# Result: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
```

### Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are similar to comprehensions but create generators, which produce values on-demand rather than storing them all in memory.

```python
# Generator expression
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1, 6))

# Using the generator
for square in squares_gen:
    print(square)
```

**Why use generators?** They are memory-efficient for large datasets since they generate values as needed rather than storing all values in memory at once.

## 15. Context Managers

Context managers provide a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to.

```python
# File handling with context manager (we saw this earlier)
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Creating Your Own Context Manager

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Entering context with {self.name}")
        return self  # Return a reference to the object
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print(f"Exiting context with {self.name}")
        # Return True to suppress exceptions, False to propagate them
        return False

# Using the custom context manager
with MyContextManager("test") as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
```

**Why use context managers?** They ensure proper resource management by automatically handling setup and cleanup operations, even if errors occur.

## Final Thoughts

This guide covers a wide range of Python concepts from beginner to advanced. Remember that programming is a journey – don't feel overwhelmed if some concepts seem difficult at first. Practice regularly, experiment with code, and build projects to reinforce your learning.

For each topic, ask yourself:
1. Do I understand the concept?
2. Can I explain it in my own words?
3. Can I write code that uses this concept?

Happy coding, and enjoy your Python journey!
